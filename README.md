# AntarBhukti

**AntarBhukti** is a powerful verification tool for evolving software, designed to analyze changes between two versions of Sequential Function Charts (SFCs)‚Äîa source and a target. Purpose-built for OSCAT application benchmarks, AntarBhukti enables accurate, reliable, and efficient verification for automation engineers and researchers.

## üöÄ Features

- **SFC Comparison:** Precisely verifies the evolution of software using textual SFC representations.
- **User-Friendly CLI:** Intuitive command-line interface for seamless and rapid verification tasks.
- **Comprehensive Benchmarks:** Extensively tested on all 80 OSCAT benchmark applications.
  - `Benchmrak-Source-OSCAT.txt`: Contains 50 source/original SFCs.
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Input Formatting Required:**
      - Replace `"steps":` with `steps=`
      - Replace `"transitions":` with `transitions=`
      - Replace `"variables":` with `variables=`
      - Add: `initial_step="Init"`
  - `Benchmarks-Upgrade-OSCAT.txt`: Contains 50 upgraded/target SFCs.
    - *Use the same formatting as `Benchmrak-Source-OSCAT.txt`.*
- **Superior Performance:** Outperforms [verifaps](https://formal.kastel.kit.edu/~weigl/verifaps/index.html) in both coverage and flexibility.
- **Open ST Reference:** Structured Text (ST) code for the OSCAT library is available at [www.oscat.de](https://www.oscat.de).
- **Clear Results:** Output is stored in an HTML file for better visualization and understanding.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Required Files

- `driver.py`
- `sfc.py`
- `sfc_verifier.py`
- `genreport.py`
- `iec61131.py`

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [Z3 SMT solver](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) (Python bindings)

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Usage

```sh
python3 driver.py <SFC-source.txt> <SFC-upgrade.txt>
```

- `<SFC-source.txt>`: Path to the source SFC file.
- `<SFC-upgrade.txt>`: Path to the upgraded (evolved) SFC file.

---

### Example

> **Note:** If your source and upgraded SFC files have different names, update the following lines in the code:

**In `driver.py` (lines 47 and 48):**
```python
sfc1.load("SFC-source.txt")  # Replace with your source filename
sfc2.load("SFC-upgrade.txt") # Replace with your upgrade filename
```
**In `sfc.py` (line 213):**
```python
sfc.load("SFC-source.txt")   # Replace with your source filename
```
**Then run:**
```sh
python3 driver.py <your_filename_source>.txt <your_filename_upgrade>.txt
```

**Current version example:**  
Run the tool on a DEC to HEX converter:
```sh
python3 driver.py dec2hex.txt dec2hex_mod.txt
```
